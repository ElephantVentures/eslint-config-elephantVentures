# Why?
We have many projects with inconsistent formatting. Hopefully this will create a more uniform style

# Goal
The start will include some basic community configs. However, my intention is to start handling single rules as time permits

# How to use?
Install eslint per usual then extend this configuration like so:
```json
    {
        "extends": "name coming soon here"
    }
```

# Configs used here
eslint and prettier. Other configs to be added here as I figure out a set style that will encompass vanilla JS projects and React alike.
